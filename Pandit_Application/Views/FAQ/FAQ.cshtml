                                                As soon as we receive your puja request, your chosen specialist studies all the details you provided to understand the need for the chosen puja. Then your
                                                specialist will connect with you and take your sankalp, and your puja is started. While the puja is being performed you are advised to sit in a quiet place
                                                or temple and chant the mantra which the specialist will provide you. A puja can take anywhere from 1 to 7 hours depending on what kind of puja you choose.
                                                Once the puja is done the specialist
                                                will connect with you again and transfer you all the energy and vibes created during the puja, this is sankalp purti and marks the end of the puja.

                                                As soon as we receive your request, your chosen specialist studies all the details you provide. As per the allocated slot the specialist will connect with you on phone, take your sankalp, and your puja/service will start. While the puja/service is being performed you are advised to sit in a quiet place or temple and chant the mantra which the specialist will provide you over the call while taking the sankalp, if required in that specific puja/service. A puja/service can take anywhere from 1 to 7 hours depending on what kind of puja/service you choose. Once the puja/service is done the specialist will connect with you again and transfer you all the energy and vibes created during the puja/service, this is sankalp purti and it marks the end of the puja/service booked.
